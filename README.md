Hi, I'm Amr!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Computer Science student at South Valley National University (SVNU), currently on a journey to master C++, Python, and Java. My goal is to explore problem-solving, algorithmic challenges, and dive deep into AI.

🚀 Roadmap

Each year, I'll be focusing on one language, starting with a "Hello, World" program on GitHub and working on projects in between:

01/04/2025 – C++ (Competitive Programming, System-Level Projects)

01/05/2026 – Python (Scripting, Automation, AI Foundations)

01/06/2027 – Java (Backend Development, Scalable Applications)

🔧 Skills & Interests

Problem Solving & Competitive Programming (Codeforces).

C++ & Python & Java (Currently learning, improving daily).

Planning to dive into AI development in my later years of study.

📌 Featured Projects

I'll be building projects along the way for each language. Go ahead and check the repos!
