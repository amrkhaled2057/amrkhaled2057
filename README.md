Hi, I'm Amr!

Computer Science student | Problem Solver | Future AI Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Computer Science student at South Valley National University (SVNU), currently on a journey to master C++, Python, and Java. My goal is to explore problem-solving, algorithmic challenges, and dive deep into AI.

ðŸš€ Roadmap

Each year, I'll be focusing on one language, starting with a "Hello, World" program on GitHub and working on projects in between:

01/04/2025 â€“ C++ (Competitive Programming, System-Level Projects)

01/05/2026 â€“ Python (Scripting, Automation, AI Foundations)

01/06/2027 â€“ Java (Backend Development, Scalable Applications)

ðŸ”§ Skills & Interests

Problem Solving & Competitive Programming (Codeforces, LeetCode).

C++ & Python & Java (Currently learning, improving daily).

Planning to dive into AI development in my later years of study.

ðŸ“Œ Featured Projects

I'll be building projects along the way for each language. Go ahead and check the repos!
